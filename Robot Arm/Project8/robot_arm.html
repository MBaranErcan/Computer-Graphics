I used the same order as in the pdf: </br>
• f/F – Open/Close claw</br>
• x/X: to rotate the arm on the X axis so you can see it from different angles </br>
• y/Y: to rotate the arm on the Y axis so you can see it from different angles </br>
• a/A: to rotate the fingers on the x-axis with a positive direction </br>
• b/B: to rotate the fingers on the x-axis with a negative direction </br>
• m/M: to rotate the fingers on the y-axis with a positive direction</br>
• n/N: to rotate the fingers on the y-axis with negative direction </br>
• t/T: toggle between solid and wire cubes</br>
• p/P: toggle between perspective and ortho projections
